# Lung_disease_detector_project

## This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can predict lung disease from chest X-ray images. The model is built using Python and the TensorFlow deep learning framework. With this model, you can classify chest X-ray images into different lung disease categories, such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or healthy lungs.
